The full task description can be found in [Task.md](Task.md) file. 


## Data Set Information:

The data is related with direct marketing campaigns of a Portuguese banking institution. The marketing campaigns were based on phone calls. Often, more than one contact to the same client was required, in order to access if the product (has_deposit) would be ('yes') or not ('no') subscribed.

## Attribute Information:

### Bank client data:

* age (numeric)
* job: type of job (categorical: 'admin.', 'blue-collar', 'entrepreneur', 'housemaid', 'management', 'retired', 'self-employed', 'services', 'student', 'technician', 'unemployed', 'unknown')
* marital: marital status (categorical: 'divorced', 'married', 'single', 'unknown' ; note: 'divorced' means divorced or widowed)
* education: (categorical: 'basic.4y', 'basic.6y', 'basic.9y', 'high.school', 'illiterate', 'professional.course', 'university.degree', 'unknown')
* default: has credit in default? (categorical: 'no', 'yes', 'unknown')
* housing: has housing loan? (categorical: 'no', 'yes', 'unknown')
* loan: has personal loan? (categorical: 'no', 'yes', 'unknown')

### Related with the last contact of the current campaign:
* contact: contact communication type (categorical:'cellular','telephone')
* month: last contact month of year (categorical: 'jan', 'feb', 'mar', â€¦, 'nov', 'dec')
* day_of_week: last contact day of the week (categorical:'mon','tue','wed','thu','fri')
* duration: last contact duration, in seconds (numeric). Important note: this attribute highly affects the output target (e.g., if duration=0 then has_deposit='no'). Yet, the duration is not known before a call is performed. Also, after the end of the call 'has_deposit' value is obviously known. Thus, this input should only be included for benchmark purposes and should be discarded if the intention is to have a realistic predictive model.

### Other attributes:
* campaign: number of contacts performed during this campaign and for this client (numeric, includes last contact)
* pdays: number of days that passed by after the client was last contacted from a previous campaign (numeric, value of 999 means that client was not previously contacted)
* previous: number of contacts performed before this campaign and for this client (numeric)
* poutcome: outcome of the previous marketing campaign (categorical: 'failure','nonexistent','success')

### Social and economic context attributes
* emp_var_rate: employment variation rate - quarterly indicator (numeric)
* cons_price_idx: consumer price index - monthly indicator (numeric)
* cons_conf_idx: consumer confidence index - monthly indicator (numeric)
* euribor3m: euribor 3 month rate - daily indicator (numeric)
* nr_employed: number of employees - quarterly indicator (numeric)

### Desired target:
* has_deposit - has the client subscribed a term deposit? (binary: 'yes', 'no')
